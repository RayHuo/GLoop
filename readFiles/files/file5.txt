Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity squad, and tallied several 40-point games.[9] 
The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm)[3] and trained rigorously. 
Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.[1][10]
